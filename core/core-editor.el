;;; File handling

;; Resolve symlinks when opening files, so that any operations are conducted
;; from the file's true directory (like `find-file').
(setq vc-follow-symlinks t)
;(setq find-file-visit-truename t)   ; Does not work with org-roam

;; Disable the warning "X and Y are the same file". It's fine to ignore this
;; warning as it will redirect you to the existing buffer anyway.
(setq find-file-suppress-same-file-warnings t)

;; Don't generate backups or lockfiles. While auto-save maintains a copy so long
;; as a buffer is unsaved, backups create copies once, when the file is first
;; written, and never again until it is killed and reopened. This is better
;; suited to version control, and I don't want world-readable copies of
;; potentially sensitive material floating around our filesystem.
(setq create-lockfiles nil
      make-backup-files nil
      ;; But in case the user does enable it, some sensible defaults:
      version-control t     ; number each backup file
      backup-by-copying t   ; instead of renaming current file (clobbers links)
      delete-old-versions t ; clean up after itself
      kept-old-versions 5
      kept-new-versions 5
      backup-directory-alist (list (cons "." (concat semacs-cache-dir "backup/")))
      tramp-backup-directory-alist backup-directory-alist)

;; But turn on auto-save, so we have a fallback in case of crashes or lost data.
;; Use `recover-file' or `recover-session' to recover them.
(setq auto-save-default t
      ;; Don't auto-disable auto-save after deleting big chunks. This defeats
      ;; the purpose of a failsafe. This adds the risk of losing the data we
      ;; just deleted, but I believe that's VCS's jurisdiction, not ours.
      auto-save-include-big-deletions t
      ;; Keep it out of `semacs-emacs-dir' or the local directory.
      auto-save-list-file-prefix (concat semacs-cache-dir "autosave/")
      tramp-auto-save-directory  (concat semacs-cache-dir "tramp-autosave/")
      auto-save-file-name-transforms
      (list (list "\\`/[^/]*:\\([^/]*/\\)*\\([^/]*\\)\\'"
                  ;; Prefix tramp autosaves to prevent conflicts with local ones

;;; Formatting

;; Favor spaces over tabs. Pls dun h8, but I think spaces (and 4 of them) is a
;; more consistent default than 8-space tabs. It can be changed on a per-mode
;; basis anyway (and is, where tabs are the canonical style, like go-mode).
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil
              tab-width 4)

;; Only indent the line when at BOL or in a line's indentation. Anywhere else,
;; insert literal indentation.
(setq-default tab-always-indent nil)

;; Make `tabify' and `untabify' only affect indentation. Not tabs/spaces in the
;; middle of a line.
(setq tabify-regexp "^\t* [ \t]+")

; An archaic default in the age of widescreen 4k displays? I disagree. We still
;; frequently split our terminals and editor frames, or have them side-by-side,
;; using up more of that newly available horizontal real-estate.
(setq-default fill-column 80)

;; Continue wrapped words at whitespace, rather than in the middle of a word.
(setq-default word-wrap t)
;; ...but don't do any wrapping by default. It's expensive. Enable
;; `visual-line-mode' if you want soft line-wrapping. `auto-fill-mode' for hard
;; line-wrapping.
(setq-default truncate-lines t)

;; If enabled (and `truncate-lines' was disabled), soft wrapping no longer
;; occurs when that window is less than `truncate-partial-width-windows'
;; characters wide. We don't need this, and it's extra work for Emacs otherwise,
;; so off it goes.
(setq truncate-partial-width-windows nil)

;; This was a widespread practice in the days of typewriters. I actually prefer
;; it when writing prose with monospace fonts, but it is obsolete otherwise.
(setq sentence-end-double-space nil)

;; The POSIX standard defines a line is "a sequence of zero or more non-newline
;; characters followed by a terminating newline", so files should end in a
;; newline. Windows doesn't respect this (because it's Windows), but we should,
;; since programmers' tools tend to be POSIX compliant (and no big deal if not).
(setq require-final-newline t)

;; Default to soft line-wrapping in text modes. It is more sensibile for text
;; modes, even if hard wrapping is more performant.
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)

;;; Clipboard / kill-ring

(setq kill-do-not-save-duplicates t)

;; Allow UTF or composed text from the clipboard, even in the terminal or on
;; non-X systems (like Windows or macOS), where only `STRING' is used.
(setq x-select-request-type '(UTF8_STRING COMPOUND_TEXT TEXT STRING))
