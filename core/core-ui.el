      ;; cursor more than N lines past window edges (where N is the settings of

;; The blinking cursor is distracting, but also interferes with cursor settings
;; in some minor modes that try to change it buffer-locally (like treemacs) and
;; can cause freezing for folks (esp on macOS) with customized & color cursors.
